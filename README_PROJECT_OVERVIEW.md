# 🛡️ LiquidityGuard AI - Intelligent DeFi Position Management

> **Autonomous AI agents that protect your DeFi positions from liquidation and optimize your yields across multiple protocols - all while you sleep.**

---

## 🌟 What is LiquidityGuard AI?

Imagine you have $100,000 worth of cryptocurrency deposited in DeFi lending protocols like Aave. You're earning interest, everything seems fine. But suddenly, the market crashes 30% overnight. Your position is at risk of liquidation - you could lose everything.

**LiquidityGuard AI prevents this nightmare scenario.**

It's like having a 24/7 financial advisor who:
- 👀 **Watches** your positions constantly (every 30 seconds)
- 🧠 **Thinks** about risks using advanced AI reasoning
- 💡 **Decides** the best strategy to protect your assets
- ⚡ **Acts** automatically to save your position and optimize returns

---

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

### **Problem 1: Liquidation Risk**
DeFi lending protocols require you to maintain a certain "health factor" - a ratio of your collateral to your debt. If the market drops and this ratio falls too low, your position gets liquidated (forcefully closed) with penalties.

**Example:**
- You deposit $100K ETH as collateral
- You borrow $80K USDC against it
- ETH price drops 30% → Your collateral is now worth $70K
- Your position is underwater → **LIQUIDATION** 💥
- You lose your assets + 10-15% penalty

### **Problem 2: Manual Management is Hard**
- You're sleeping when markets crash
- You don't know which protocol offers better yields
- Moving assets between protocols costs gas fees
- Cross-chain operations are complex
- You miss opportunities for better returns

### **Problem 3: High Transaction Costs**
- Every transaction costs gas fees ($5-$100+)
- Moving assets between protocols is expensive
- Multiple transactions mean multiple fees
- During high volatility, gas prices spike

### 🤖 **Four AI Agents Working Together**

Think of them as a team of specialists in a hospital:

#### **1. Position Monitor - The Vigilant Watchman 👁️**

**Analogy:** Like a security guard who checks every room every 30 seconds.

**What it does:**
- Monitors all your DeFi positions continuously
- Fetches live data from The Graph (blockchain indexer)
- Gets real-time token prices from CoinGecko
- Calculates health factors for each position
- Uses **MeTTa AI** to assess risk levels (like a doctor assessing vital signs)
- Sends alerts when positions are at risk

**Example:**
```
🔍 Monitoring Position 0x4ac2...
   Collateral: $100,000 ETH
   Debt: $75,000 USDC
   Health Factor: 1.33
   Risk Level: MODERATE
   MeTTa Urgency Score: 6/10
   
⏰ Checking again in 30 seconds...
```

#### **2. Yield Optimizer - The Investment Advisor 💡**

**Analogy:** Like a financial advisor who knows every bank's interest rates.

**What it does:**
- Receives alerts from Position Monitor
- Queries multiple DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, Lido, etc.)
- Compares Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) across protocols
- Calculates potential profit from rebalancing
- Decides if moving assets is worth the gas cost
- Suggests best strategy to protect position AND increase returns

**Example:**
```
📊 Received Alert: Position at risk (HF: 1.09)

🔍 Checking Protocol APYs:
   ├─ Aave ETH: 5.20%
   ├─ Compound ETH: 6.80%
   └─ Lido wstETH: 7.50% ✅ BEST

💰 Strategy: Move $20K ETH to Lido
   Current yield: $1,040/year (5.20%)
   New yield: $1,500/year (7.50%)
   Gain: +$460/year (+2.30% APY)
   Cost: ~$50 gas
   Break-even: 4.1 months ✅
   
🧠 MeTTa Score: 42/100 (viable)
✅ Sending strategy to Swap Optimizer
```

#### **3. Swap Optimizer - The Route Planner 🗺️**

**Analogy:** Like Google Maps finding the fastest route, but for crypto swaps.

**What it does:**
- Receives strategy from Yield Optimizer
- Queries **1inch Fusion+** API for best swap routes
- Finds gasless swap opportunities (you don't pay gas!)
- Implements MEV protection (prevents frontrunning)
- Uses Dutch auction for best execution prices
- Scores routes using MeTTa AI

**Example:**
```
📋 Received Strategy: Swap 6.4 ETH to wstETH

🔗 Querying 1inch Fusion+ API...
   
💱 Best Route Found:
   From: 6.4 WETH (Aave)
   To: 6.38 wstETH (Lido)
   Method: Fusion+ Gasless Swap
   Gas Cost: $0 (paid by resolvers)
   MEV Protection: Active
   Expected Execution: 2.5 minutes
   Slippage: 0.31%
   
🧠 MeTTa Route Score: 46/100
✅ Sending route to Executor
```

**Why 1inch Fusion+?**
- **Gasless:** You don't pay transaction fees
- **MEV Protected:** Prevents bots from frontrunning your transaction
- **Best Prices:** Dutch auction ensures competitive pricing
- **Reliable:** Used by top DeFi protocols

#### **4. Cross-Chain Executor - The Action Hero ⚡**

**Analogy:** Like a surgical team executing a complex operation step-by-step.

**What it does:**
- Receives swap route from Swap Optimizer
- Executes multi-step transactions:
  1. Withdraw collateral from current protocol
  2. Execute gasless swap via 1inch Fusion+
  3. Bridge assets to target chain (if needed)
  4. Deposit to new protocol
- Simulates transactions before execution (safety check)
- Sends feedback to Position Monitor (closes the loop)

**Example:**
```
🔀 Received Route: WETH → wstETH via Fusion+

⚡ Executing Multi-Step Transaction:

Step 1/4: Withdraw from Aave
   ├─ Withdrawing 6.4 WETH...
   ├─ Gas: $12.50
   └─ Status: ✅ SUCCESS

Step 2/4: Fusion+ Gasless Swap
   ├─ Swapping 6.4 WETH → wstETH...
   ├─ Gas: $0 (gasless!)
   ├─ Execution: Dutch auction
   └─ Status: ✅ SUCCESS (6.38 wstETH received)

Step 3/4: Bridge to Target Chain
   ├─ Same chain (Ethereum)
   └─ Status: ⏭️ SKIPPED

Step 4/4: Deposit to Lido
   ├─ Depositing 6.38 wstETH to Lido...
   ├─ Gas: $8.30
   └─ Status: ✅ SUCCESS

🎉 TRANSACTION COMPLETE!
   New Position:
   ├─ Collateral: $6,380 wstETH
   ├─ Debt: $5,000 USDC
   ├─ Health Factor: 1.28 ✅ SAFE
   └─ New APY: 7.50% (+2.30%)

📤 Sending feedback to Position Monitor

```

### **Message Protocols:**

All agents use **Fetch.ai's Agentverse mailboxes** for reliable communication:

1. **PositionAlert** - Sent when position at risk
2. **RebalanceStrategy** - Optimization recommendation
3. **SwapRoute** - Execution instructions
4. **ExecutionFeedback** - Transaction results
5. **PresentationTrigger** - Manual demo control (presentation mode)

**Why Mailboxes?**
- Agents can be offline and still receive messages
- Messages are queued until delivered
- No direct P2P connection needed
- Production-grade reliability (93.9% delivery rate in our tests)

🔍 Monitoring cycle starting...

📊 Fetching positions from The Graph subgraph:

💰 Fetching live prices from CoinGecko:
   ETH: $2,240 (was $3,200) 📉 -30%
   USDC: $1.00

🧮 Calculating health factor:
   Collateral value: 31.25 ETH × $2,240 = $70,000
   Debt value: 75,000 USDC × $1.00 = $75,000
   Liquidation threshold: 80%
