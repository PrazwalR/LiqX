# 🎬 PRESENTATION MODE - Complete Guide

**LiquidityGuard AI - Live Demo for Judges**

---

## 🎯 What is Presentation Mode?

**Presentation Mode** is a special hybrid mode that combines:
- ✅ **100% REAL blockchain data** (Aave V3 positions, CoinGecko prices, The Graph subgraph)
- ✅ **Manual trigger control** (You decide when to demonstrate the flow)
- ✅ **Perfect timing** (No waiting for random market events)
- ✅ **Impressive demo** (Show complete end-to-end automation)

**Why it's better than pure demo mode:**
- Judges see REAL production capabilities (not just simulations)
- You maintain control over timing (no awkward waiting)
- You can trigger events on demand (perfect for presentations)
- It's transparent and honest (builds trust with judges)

---

## ⚙️  Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Enable Presentation Mode**

Edit your `.env` file:

```bash
# Set PRESENTATION_MODE to true
PRESENTATION_MODE=true
DEMO_MODE=false
PRODUCTION_MODE=false

# Optional: Change the trigger secret for security
PRESENTATION_TRIGGER_SECRET="your_custom_secret_here"
```

**Important:** Only ONE mode should be `true` at a time.

---

### **Step 2: Start All Agents**

Open 4 terminal windows:

**Terminal 1: Position Monitor**
```bash
cd /Users/prazw/Desktop/LiqX
source .venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=/Users/prazw/Desktop/LiqX
python agents/position_monitor.py
```

**Terminal 2: Yield Optimizer**
```bash
cd /Users/prazw/Desktop/LiqX
source .venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=/Users/prazw/Desktop/LiqX
python agents/yield_optimizer.py
```

**Terminal 3: Swap Optimizer**
```bash
cd /Users/prazw/Desktop/LiqX
source .venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=/Users/prazw/Desktop/LiqX
python agents/swap_optimizer.py
```

**Terminal 4: Cross-Chain Executor**
```bash
cd /Users/prazw/Desktop/LiqX
source .venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=/Users/prazw/Desktop/LiqX
python agents/cross_chain_executor.py
```

**Wait 10 seconds** for all agents to initialize and connect to Agentverse.

---

### **Step 3: Verify Real Data is Loading**

Check Terminal 1 (Position Monitor) logs:

You should see:
```
✅ Position Monitor Agent ready!
🔍 Fetching risky positions from subgraph...
📊 [🎬 PRESENTATION] Found 19 risky positions from subgraph
✅ Loaded 19 positions for monitoring
💰 CoinGecko: WETH = $3,847.97
💰 CoinGecko: USDC = $1.00
```

**This confirms:**
- ✅ Real positions loaded from The Graph
- ✅ Real prices from CoinGecko
- ✅ System monitoring live blockchain data

---

## 🎭 Live Presentation Flow

### **Act 1: Show Production System (2-3 minutes)**

**What to Say:**
> "Our system is currently monitoring 19 real DeFi positions on Aave V3 Sepolia testnet. 
> Let me show you the live data..."

**What to Show:**

1. **Open The Graph Studio** in browser:
   - URL: https://studio.thegraph.com/subgraph/liq-x/
   - Run query: Show real positions with health factors
   - Point out: "This is actual blockchain data, updated every block"

2. **Show Position Monitor Logs**:
   - Terminal 1: Show position fetching
   - Highlight: "19 positions loaded"
   - Highlight: "Live CoinGecko prices: WETH=$3,847.97"

3. **Explain the Problem**:
   > "These users have collateral in ETH. If ETH price crashes 30%, 
   > their health factors will drop below safe levels and they risk liquidation.
   > Let me demonstrate how our system protects them..."

---

### **Act 2: Trigger the Demo (4-5 minutes)**

**Terminal 5: Open new terminal for triggers**

```bash
cd /Users/prazw/Desktop/LiqX
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Trigger 1: Market Crash**

```bash
python scripts/trigger_presentation.py --event market_crash --eth-drop 30
```

**What Happens (point to each terminal):**

**Terminal 1 (Position Monitor):**
```
🚨 SIMULATED MARKET CRASH: ETH $3,847.97 → $2,693.58 (-30%)
🔍 Recalculating health factors...
⚠️ ALERT SENT: Position 0x4ac2... | HF: 0.87 | Risk: CRITICAL
⚠️ ALERT SENT: Position 0x49ab... | HF: 0.92 | Risk: CRITICAL
```

**Terminal 2 (Yield Optimizer):**
```
⚠️ POSITION ALERT RECEIVED
   User: 0x4ac2...
   Protocol: aave-v3 (ethereum-sepolia)
   Health Factor: 0.87 (CRITICAL)
   Collateral: $75,234 WETH
   Debt: $58,192 USDC

📊 Calculating optimal rebalancing strategy...
💡 Best yield: Lido stETH (7.5% APY vs current 5.2%)
📈 APY improvement: +2.3% = $1,730/year extra yield
💰 Break-even time: 2.1 months

✅ STRATEGY SENT to Swap Optimizer
```

**Terminal 3 (Swap Optimizer):**
```
📋 REBALANCE STRATEGY RECEIVED
🔗 Querying 1inch Fusion+ API...

[Note: Show code explaining Fusion+ is mainnet-only]

💡 In production mainnet, this would get real gasless swap quotes
🛡️ Features: Gasless execution, MEV protection, optimal routing

✅ MOCK ROUTE SENT to Executor (for testnet demonstration)
```

**Terminal 4 (Executor):**
```
🔀 SWAP ROUTE RECEIVED

⚡ Executing multi-step rebalancing transaction:
   Step 1/4: Withdraw $20,000 WETH from Aave V3... ✅ (1.2s)
   Step 2/4: Fusion+ gasless swap WETH → wstETH... ✅ (0.8s)
   Step 3/4: Bridge to target chain (if needed)... ⏭️ (same chain)
   Step 4/4: Deposit $20,000 wstETH to Lido... ✅ (1.1s)

🎉 EXECUTION COMPLETE!
   Position health factor improved: 0.87 → 1.42
   Position safe from liquidation ✅
   User now earning higher APY (7.5% vs 5.2%)
```

**What to Emphasize:**
- ⚡ **Speed**: Complete flow in 3-5 seconds
- 🤖 **Autonomous**: No human intervention needed
- 💰 **Profitable**: Higher yield + liquidation protection
- 🛡️ **Safe**: Gasless swaps, MEV protection

### **Act 3: Technical Deep Dive (2-3 minutes)**

**Show the Code:**

1. **1inch Fusion+ Integration** (`agents/swap_optimizer.py`):
```python
# Show actual API integration code
url = f"{FUSION_QUOTER_URL}/{chain_id}/quote/receive"
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {ONEINCH_API_KEY}'}
```
> "This is production-ready code with authenticated API access.
> We're on testnet for safety, but this works on 8 mainnets."

2. **MeTTa AI Reasoning** (`agents/metta_reasoner.py`):
```python
def assess_risk(health_factor, collateral, debt):
    risk_level = calculate_risk_level(health_factor)
    liquidation_prob = liquidation_probability(health_factor, volatility)
    urgency = urgency_score(health_factor, liquidation_prob)
```
> "Our system uses symbolic AI reasoning to make intelligent decisions.
> It's not just if-else statements - it's actual AI risk assessment."

3. **Architecture Diagram** (draw on whiteboard):
```
Position Monitor → Yield Optimizer → Swap Optimizer → Executor
     ↓                  ↓                 ↓               ↓
  Subgraph          Protocol APYs    1inch Fusion+    Web3 TX
  (The Graph)       (DeFi Llama)     (Gasless)        (Execution)
```

### **Act 4: Handle Questions (3-5 minutes)**

**Common Judge Questions:**

**Q: "Is this real or simulated?"**

**A:** 
> "Great question! The monitoring is 100% real - those are actual Aave V3 positions 
> from Ethereum Sepolia testnet. The prices are live from CoinGecko. The subgraph 
> is querying real blockchain data. For demonstration purposes, I triggered a simulated 
> market crash because we can't crash the real market on demand. But the system runs 
> 24/7 monitoring real positions and would respond automatically to real price movements."

**Q: "Why not show it on mainnet?"**

**A:**
> "Two reasons: 1) Safety - we don't want to risk real funds during development. 
> 2) Cost - Sepolia testnet is free while mainnet would cost gas fees. However, 
> our code is mainnet-ready. We have authenticated 1inch Fusion+ API access 
> which works on 8 mainnets. The only code change needed for mainnet deployment 
> is updating RPC URLs in our .env file."

**Q: "How do you prevent liquidation?"**

**A:**
> "We use a three-step protection strategy: 
> 1) Early detection - we alert when health factor < 1.5, well before liquidation at 1.0
> 2) Smart rebalancing - we move collateral to higher-yield protocols, improving both 
> safety AND profitability
> 3) Gasless execution - we use 1inch Fusion+ so users don't pay gas fees, and they're 
> protected from MEV attacks"

**Q: "What makes this better than existing solutions?"**

**A:**
> "Three key innovations:
> 1) Autonomous AI agents - fully automated, no user action needed
> 2) Proactive not reactive - we prevent liquidation before it happens
> 3) Yield optimization - we don't just protect, we improve profitability
> Most liquidation bots just alert users or charge high fees. We take automated 
> action to both protect AND optimize their position."

## 🎯 Trigger Commands Reference

### **Market Crash (Most Impressive)**
```bash
# 30% ETH price drop
python scripts/trigger_presentation.py --event market_crash --eth-drop 30

# 50% ETH price drop (more dramatic)
python scripts/trigger_presentation.py --event market_crash --eth-drop 50

# 20% ETH price drop (more realistic)
python scripts/trigger_presentation.py --event market_crash --eth-drop 20
```

### **Alert Specific Position**
```bash
# Force alert for first available position
python scripts/trigger_presentation.py --event alert_position

# Force alert for specific position ID
python scripts/trigger_presentation.py --event alert_position --position-id 0x123abc...
```

### **Custom Price Changes**
```bash
# Set WETH to $2,500
python scripts/trigger_presentation.py --event price_drop --token WETH --price 2500

# Set ETH to $2,000
python scripts/trigger_presentation.py --event price_drop --token ETH --price 2000

# Set USDC to $0.95 (depeg scenario)
python scripts/trigger_presentation.py --event price_drop --token USDC --price 0.95
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "PRESENTATION TRIGGER REJECTED: Not in PRESENTATION_MODE"**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check .env file
cat .env | grep PRESENTATION_MODE

# Should show:
# PRESENTATION_MODE=true

# If not, edit .env and set:
PRESENTATION_MODE=true
DEMO_MODE=false

# Restart all agents
```

---

### **Problem: "Invalid secret"**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check your secret in .env
cat .env | grep PRESENTATION_TRIGGER_SECRET

# Make sure trigger script uses same secret
# Default is: liqx_demo_2025
```

---

### **Problem: Agents not receiving triggers**

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check agents are running
ps aux | grep "python agents" | grep -v grep

# Should show 4 processes

# 2. Check agent logs for errors
tail -f logs/position_monitor.log

# 3. Verify Agentverse connection
# Look for: "Agent initialized in ALMANAC mode"
```

---

### **Problem: No positions loaded**

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check subgraph is accessible
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ positions(first: 5) { id healthFactor } }"}' \
  https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/1704206/liq-x/v0.1.0

# 2. Check .env has correct subgraph URL
cat .env | grep LIQX_SUBGRAPH_URL

# 3. Wait 30 seconds for monitoring cycle
```
